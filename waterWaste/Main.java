    The purpose of this program is to spread awareness of excessive water usage to the user. This will be done by telling and visually showering the user how much water they use when they take a shower. 
    The program will prompt the user for how many minutes they shower for. If the user does not enter a positive number, a while loop will be used to continue asking them for a valid value. By multiplying the number of minutes by the average number of litres of water used in a shower, the program will calculate the number of litres used by the user in a shower.
    When the number of litres has been calculated, a for loop will be used to display a number of symbols to represent how many litres the user uses in a shower.
    Towards the end, there will be an if statement that first determines if the user showers for the recommended time. If they do not, the excess minutes in the shower and wasted water of the excess time will be calculated by subtracting 5 from the time and multiplying that time by the same number of litres used in the shower per minute respectively.
    The next message to the user will vary depending on if they shower for 1 excess minute,
    up to 10 excess minutes, or if they shower for even more than that, with each message getting harsher as more water is wasted.
    **********************
    Could add an idea of asking the user how long they plan to live and calculate how much water they'd used in their lifetime's worth of showers
    **********************
    pls do not hate me for trying to exception handle. I just wanted to delay the program, that's it I promise.
