# Definitely Not World Changing Apps
This is a collection of projects that bring light to many of the world's issues. Sadly enough, their impact as terminal text-based programs is minimal to say the least. Well, at least the intent is there.

## waterWaste
Literally takes in the number of hours the user showers and spits out facts and information that relate to their magnitude of wastage.

## buckRoad
This is a condensed version of the Dollar Street website from gapminder.org. With this program, you can look at various lifestyles of people living in poverty and the differences $10 a month can make.

## hungerSimulator
Though probably not realistic at all in terms of numbers and chances, this is a simulator where you try to survive as a farmer in harsh climate (due to climate change). The only accurate thing about this simulator is how difficult you think it is versus how it actually is. Again, as it's most definitely way harder in real life, the game is meant to show you this while still providing you a chance.

The 2nd edition of this just keeps your score and a little user tag whenever you die/finish the game, similar to that of an arcade scoreboard.

## turtleSimulator
Okay, now this one is straight-up impossible. You live as this turtle who has to migrate constantly between islands, watch out for predators, and lay enough eggs within 40 turns (each turn representing a year irl)... all while you try to survive every natural disaster that exists, since it is 2050 and climate change has made these common occurrences. 

## tasker
This is your very typical to-do list program. In order to save the list the user keeps, the program uses Serialization to save an ArrayList object with each task inside.

The 2nd edition just implements the same program with a couple of additions using OOP Inheritance

The 3rd edition is just the 2nd edition but with OOP Polymorphism.
